**Antimicrobial resistance in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. (Langford et al., 2022)**

**Introduction**

This systemic review and meta-analysis study investigates the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in patients infected with COVID-19. A drastic increase in antimicrobial resistance has been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic and available evidence shows that the prevalence of bacterial co-infection and secondary infection among COVID-19 patients is low (Langford et al., 2020). The observation indicates that there has been a significant rise in the use of antibiotics among COVID-19 patients even though it is a viral infection. This controversial statistic was hypothesized to establish a global prevalence and predictors of bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients with COVID-19 by assessing the available evidence. This is important because the overuse of antibiotics is feared to exacerbate the already serious global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

**Methodology**

The study explored the incidence and patterns of AMR in COVID-19 patients by systematically analyzing data from 148 sources critically obtained from the WHO COVID-19 Research Database, including cohort studies, case series, case-control trials, and randomized controlled trials; it used important exclusion criteria to reduce bias during selection. The analysis includes data on the types of bacterial pathogens frequently found in co-infections, identifying organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli as common culprits that display resistance to multiple antibiotics, including broad-spectrum ones.

**Results**

The findings of the study correlate with the tested hypothesis; with a low prevalence of 5•3% (95% CI 3•8–7•4) for bacterial co-infections, and a moderate prevalence of 18•4% (14•0–23•7) for secondary bacterial infections. 60•8% (95% CI 38•6–79•3) of infections, and 37•5% (26•9–49•5) of isolates were resistant to antimicrobials. Meta-analysis suggested that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients contributes to the rise in drug-resistant bacterial infections. This issue is exacerbated by challenges in diagnosing secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients, leading to the liberal use of antibiotics as a precautionary measure.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the study emphasized the need for antimicrobial stewardship programs, better diagnostic tools for bacterial infections, and a more judicious use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. It is important to address AMR to prevent further global health crises since the abuse of antibiotics can undermine their effectiveness in COVID-19 cases and might render many bacterial infections untreatable in the future.
